<p>Bob Ross once said, "I think there's an artist hidden at the bottom of every single one of us." Here at Happy Little
  Trees you can join a community of likeminded people who are trying to find the artist within. You can watch every
  episode of "The Joy of Painting," share your thoughts with others, as well as which episode you are painting along
  with. We are a community of Happy Little Trees, and we believe what Bob believed, "There's nothing wrong with having a
  tree as a friend."</p>
